First the data imported and the data is normalized.
The structure of the Neural Network is as follows: 1. The input is put into the input layer which flattens the images as a data of each pixel into the level 
of grey shade as a number. 
2. Two hidden layers with Rectified Linear Unit as activation function are formed with 300 and 100 neurons each respectively.
3. The output layer with 10 neurons( no. of classes) is formed with softmax activation function. 
4. Then the model is compiled with loss as Sparse Categorical Crossentropy and optimizer as Stochastic Gradient Descent, and metric as accuracy.
5. Furthur the model is fitted with Epoch = 50 i.e. the process is of calculating estimated value and error is repeated 50 times.
6. Finally, we plot the structure to check whether it's as intended as calculate the accuracy on test set.
